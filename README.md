# FoldertoCBZ
This script converts folders of scanned manga/comics and turns them into CBZ files for reading on e-readers or comic-reading programs.

The conversion process has been tested with 7-Zip installed in the normal installation directory (C:/Program Files/7-Zip) and Spy x Family in chapters.

What has *not* been tested:
1. 7-Zip installed in different directories
2. Directory structures with special characters
3. Folders containing files other than picture files

Features to add:
1. Only select files with picture extensions to add to the archive
2. Select custom directory for 7-Zip if 7-Zip is not found at the default directory
3. Select different directory to store archive files
